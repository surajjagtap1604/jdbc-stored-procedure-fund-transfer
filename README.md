# jdbc-stored-procedure-fund-transfer
This GitHub repository contains Java code demonstrating a fund transfer system between bank accounts using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and CallableStatement API to invoke a stored procedure.
The code showcases a secure and efficient method to transfer funds from one bank account to another within a relational database management system (RDBMS) using Java. It establishes a connection with the database using JDBC and utilizes CallableStatement to execute the stored procedure responsible for managing the fund transfer operation.
Whether you're learning JDBC, exploring stored procedures, or implementing fund transfer functionality in your Java applications, this repository serves as a valuable resource and reference.
Feel free to explore, contribute, and adapt the code to suit your specific requirements or use cases.
